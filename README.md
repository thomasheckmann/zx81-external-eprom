# zx81-external-eprom
The main goal for this project is make it possible to run one of the improved version of the ZX81 ROM, without the need to opening up for ZX81 and replacing the original ROM. I decided to use the W27C512 EEPROM, which makes it possible to store 8 x 8kb ROM - and made them selectable using the dip switches.

# version 1
